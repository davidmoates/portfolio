							<h2>Resume</h2>
							<p>I have here my work history and other skills. Something that is important to know, I never do just what my job title say. I always try to be more of a utility, and I try to always make myself available to help with any task.</p>

								<h3>Work History</h3>
								<p class="justify">I am currently working at a branch of <a href="http://www.memosamples.com"><b>Momentum Group</b></a>, Eykon. We sell and distribute wallcovering and upholstery products. With the job title of Order Picker, my job mostly consist of shipping and receiving samples as well as product. We have to meet strict deadline. That being said Efficiency and Organization are the most important skills I have to get the job done.</p>

								<p class="justify">I worked at 2 different sign shops where I was the Graphic Design and Installer. These jobs were the most stressful because of the deadline that were need to be met. I was able to work on Vehicle Wrap, Building Signage, Wall Wraps, Decals of all sizes, and warehouse signage. Efficiency and Organization were very importnat as well as keeping a clean work environment. I mostly work in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>

								<p class="justify"><a href="http://gbntv.org/"><b>Gospel Broadcasting Network</b></a> (<b>GBN</b>) is one of my favorite places I have worked. My offical title was Volunteer Coordinator, yet at GBN we wore many hats. I mostly head up getting volunteer to help with different tasks like mail outs, camera work, etc. I also did camera work, studio set building, setting up the cameras by running cables, etc. With this company you learn how to do everything. I also got experience working on live show. I worked a debate in front of a live audience. I still have a great relationship with GBN to this day. I had to use the full Adobe CC as well. </p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Volunteer Experience</h4>
								<p class="justify">At <a href="http://southavencoc.org/"><b>Southaven church of Christ</b></a>, I help schedule, train, and run the equipment in the Audio/Video room. I also help teach different classes on Sundays and Wednesdays, and cut the grass from time to time.</p>

								<p class="justify">I have volunteer to be a Counselor for <b>Sardis Lake Christian Camp</b> Session 2. I work with children ages 7-18. It is a week away from home for the children as well as the counselors. We play sports, have devotions, and just fun for the whole week. The counselors are considered the children's parents for that time. It is always a fun and rewarding week.</p>

								<p class="justify">My Brother-in-law (<a href="http://www.kyletaubken.com/"><b>Kyle Taubken</b></a>) is a filmmaker. He has graciously let me help him on his short films by running sound. So far I have worked on 4 short. I have linked my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9198790/?ref_=rvi_nm">IMDB</a> page to see those short.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Other Important Skills</h4>
								<p class="justify">It would be fun to say that one of my "skills" is fight Ninjas or I can shot an arrow throw a lifesaver candy. I do not have fun and cool skills like that at all, but I can do a kickflip on a skateboard.</p>

								<p class="justify">Some important skills I do have are knowledge of Adobe CC. I know Illustrator and Photoshop very well, and I am fimilar with InDesign, Premiere, and After Effects. I can also work on either macOS or Windows with easy. Linux is a learning curve, but I am comfortable using it. I have worked with both Tricaster and Blackmagic Switchers. I can work most cameras and soundboards with experience in a live setting. I also know how to wrap a cable correctly (this is for the people who know). I did have a short podcast about sports with a friend were I did most of the audio editing. Though I would be seeking work in Web Development, I want it know that I do enjoy learning new skills and can wear many hats.</p>
