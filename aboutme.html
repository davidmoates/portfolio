										<h3>Who I am</h3>
										<p class="justify">The most important things in my life are my Faith and my Family. I know that it is cheesy to say that, but it is true. I attend the <a href="http://southavencoc.org/">Southaven church of Christ</a> where I volunteer my time. My wife, Anna, is my best friend and has been since we meet while in high school. We got married on October 25, 2014. Our son, Oliver, was born on December 8, 2016, and we have not had a dull moment since. We have fun going to the zoo to see the lions (which are his favorite). We also like going to his Grammie and Poppy's house, and going to play with his cousins and Gramma Shell. We also go to see my Dad and Step-mom every Thanksgiving. We have a large family and enjoy spending time with them.</p>
										<p class="justify"> I was born outside of Atlanta, GA and move alot growing up. We finally settled in the Memphis, TN area, though my dad did stay in Georgia. I love the City of Memphis because it is an underdog city. Most people talk down about Memphis, but I proudly say it is my hometown. This city is blue collar and hard working; Grit-Grind is our motto.

								<h4>Things I Like</h4>
								<p class="justify">I love skateboarding. It has taught me to never give up and to face fears. Life is full of changes, and if you do not go for it then you will be left behind. </p>

								<p class="justify">I am a huge fan of sports. My favorite teams are in order; Memphis Grizzlies, Bayern Munich, Georgia Bulldogs, US Soccer, Tottenham Hotspurs, Atlanta Braves, Memphis Tigers, and Green Bay Packers. I also love playing any sport or talking about sports. </p>
